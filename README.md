# <center>Pegasus Launcher</center>
#### <center>Featherweight Minecraft launcher, made using Electron.</center>
***
## Why this?
Pegasus Launcher aims for the ultimate compactness and usability, which means, it abandons all the redundant, fancy functionality, while keeping the necessary bits to start Minecraft.  

## Well, how usable can it be?
Select a version, click Launch. That’s it. I’m sure you’ll learn in *10 seconds flat*.

No manual configuration is needed, as the launcher has done for you. *Although* you may want to edit that in the configuration panel.

## Forge/LiteLoader/Optifine Support?
No.  

Just kidding. Let’s talk about that later.

## Okay, sounds pretty good. Download link?
Okay, then bad news for you. Currently it’s a proof-of-concept. **Hopefully**, this launcher can finish in a feaw month, but LOL I have no guarantee for this project.  
    
For alternatives(and the inspiration of this project), how about Andy-K-Sparklight’s [Alicorn Launcher](https://github.com/Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn).
