## Why this?
Pegasus Launcher aims for the ultimate compactness (in functionality) and usability, which means, it abandons all the redundant, fancy functionality, while keeping the necessary bits to start Minecraft.  

And obviously, you don't need an AI assistant to launch Minecraft if you can do it within one click.

## Why electron?
IDK really. Electron has literally no advantages except it's JVM-independent.

For how bad is it, imagine a 250MiB Hello World app.

## Well, how usable can it be?
Select a version, click Launch. That’s it. I’m sure you’ll learn in *10 seconds flat*.

No manual configuration is needed, as the launcher has done for you. *Although* you may want to edit that in the configuration panel.

## Features?
- Download and launch Minecraft (obviously)
- Multiple accounts support including Demo/Mojang/Microsoft/Authlib-inject accounts
- Fast (threaded) download
- Beautiful and overused UI according to Material Design
- Set up OpenJDK Runtime if no JRE detected
- Advanced runtime configuration
- Log recording
- i18n support (for later)
- Bugs. Lots of bugs.

## Forge/LiteLoader/Optifine Support?
No.  

Just kidding. Let’s talk about that later.

## Okay, sounds pretty good. Download link?
Okay, then bad news for you. Currently it’s a proof-of-concept. **Hopefully**, this launcher can finish in a feaw month, but LOL I have no guarantee for this project.  
    
For alternatives(and the inspiration of this project), how about Andy-K-Sparklight’s [Alicorn Launcher](https://github.com/Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn).

## Sounds cool! I'm in.
Thanks! Others' contribution is definitely and extremely helpful for this project.  
Feel free to post issues / pull requests if you find something which can improve.
